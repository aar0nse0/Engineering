            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            Today is Thursday, meaning I am going to my odd classes today. <br>
            I have Korean, English, Engineering, and AP Human Geography. After school,<br>
            I am going to be catching up on homework from all my classes. This week <br>
            was easy and went by pretty quickly. I also tried out for the volleyball team <br>
            with a couple friends on Monday and Wednesday. I thought that a few of us would <br>
            get cut, but all of us got in. In this week's engineering class, we learned to create <br>
            this website and used halfpipes to get a marble into a bucket. The activity was <br>
            fun, but took a while and required lots of teamwork and communication. <br>

            9/11 <br>
            Today is Monday, so I have to attend both even and odd classes today. Today is also 9/11, <br>
            so there was a car parade in the morning. However, my classmates and I were late to the <br>
            entire parade because of an assignment we were working on in first period. The past few <br> 
            weeks since the first journal entry has still been managable, but there has been a slight <br>
            increase in assigned work and homework from every class. Over the past two to three weeks, <br>
            we learned and practiced CADing, and designed and started building a series of simple <br>
            machines that involved using a baseball in order to make a balloon pop. The activity required <br>
            teamwork and communication in order to get things complete quickly. <br>

            9/18 <br>
            Our class experienced difficulties updating our websites this week due to a internet problem <br>
            in our classroom. Because of this, we are writing September 18th's journal entry on the 25th. <br>
            This week, we worked on physically building our Rude Goldberg chain reaction machine. Our group <br>
            built the complete, initial design of the machine. However, we encountered a few problems whiilst <br>
            experimenting, so we made minor adjustments. We added support to our build by adding multiple <br>
            cardboard triangles on the bottom and replaced the starting pulley with a ramp that a car would <br>
            be pushed down from. After the final adjustments of our project were made, we finally tested the <br>
            machine. The test was successful, so we were finally done with our project. <br>
