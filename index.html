            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            Today is Thursday, meaning I am going to my odd classes today. <br>
            I have Korean, English, Engineering, and AP Human Geography. After school,<br>
            I am going to be catching up on homework from all my classes. This week <br>
            was easy and went by pretty quickly. I also tried out for the volleyball team <br>
            with a couple friends on Monday and Wednesday. I thought that a few of us would <br>
            get cut, but all of us got in. In this week's engineering class, we learned to create <br>
            this website and used halfpipes to get a marble into a bucket. The activity was <br>
            fun, but took a while and required lots of teamwork and communication. <br>

            9/11 <br>
            Today is Monday, so I have to attend both even and odd classes today. Today is also 9/11, <br>
            so there was a car parade in the morning. However, my classmates and I were late to the <br>
            entire parade because of an assignment we were working on in first period. The past few <br> 
            weeks since the first journal entry has still been managable, but there has been a slight <br>
            increase in assigned work and homework from every class. Over the past two to three weeks, <br>
            we learned and practiced CADing, and designed and started building a series of simple <br>
            machines that involved using a baseball in order to make a balloon pop. The activity required <br>
            teamwork and communication in order to get things complete quickly. <br>
