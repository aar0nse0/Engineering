            8/21-8/24 Week 1 <br>
            Today is Thursday, meaning I am going to my odd classes today. <br>
            I have Korean, English, Engineering, and AP Human Geography. After school,<br>
            I am going to be catching up on homework from all my classes. This week <br>
            was easy and went by pretty quickly. I also tried out for the volleyball team <br>
            with a couple friends on Monday and Wednesday. I thought that a few of us would <br>
            get cut, but all of us got in. In this week's engineering class, we learned to create <br>
            this website and used halfpipes to get a marble into a bucket. The activity was <br>
            fun, but took a while and required lots of teamwork and communication. <br>

            Today is Monday, so I have to attend both even and odd classes today. Today is also 9/11, <br>
            so there was a car parade in the morning. However, my classmates and I were late to the <br>
            entire parade because of an assignment we were working on in first period. The past few <br> 
            weeks since the first journal entry has still been managable, but there has been a slight <br>
            increase in assigned work and homework from every class. Over the past two to three weeks, <br>
            we learned and practiced CADing, and designed and started building a series of simple <br>
            machines that involved using a baseball in order to make a balloon pop. The activity required <br>
            teamwork and communication in order to get things complete quickly. <br>

            Our class experienced difficulties updating our websites this week due to a internet problem <br>
            in our classroom. Because of this, we are writing September 18th's journal entry on the 25th. <br>
            This week, we worked on physically building our Rude Goldberg chain reaction machine. Our group <br>
            built the complete, initial design of the machine. However, we encountered a few problems whiilst <br>
            experimenting, so we made minor adjustments. We added support to our build by adding multiple <br>
            cardboard triangles on the bottom and replaced the starting pulley with a ramp that a car would <br>
            be pushed down from. After the final adjustments of our project were made, we finally tested the <br>
            machine. The test was successful, so we were finally done with our project. <br>

            9/29 <br>
            This week, we dissected a computer in order to study the internals of the system. <br>
            We split the class into small groups of 2-3 people. I joined Andres and Aidan's group. <br>
            We dissected the computer by disassembling panels, cables, and other pieces with <br>
            screwdrivers. After we completely disassembled the computer, we had to put the <br>
            cables, panels, and systems back into its original places. This took us the entire <br>
            period, but it was very fun and engaging. We also filled in a worksheet by coloring <br>
            in and labeling all the parts of a computer. This took us much shorter to compelete. <br>

            October has finally arrived. This week, we built a prosthetic hand that fully <br>
            functions. We had limited supplies, so we used carboard, strings, duct tape, <br>
            and scissors to make the artificial hand. We divided our class into groups of 3 <br>
            people. I got into groups with Andres and Aidan again. While we were building <br>
            the hand, Aidan had to go to the restroom, so Andres and I had to do most of <br>
            the work. We used Andres hand as a model to trace the hand onto the cardboard, <br>
            and cut it out. Then, we cut the joints and added strings to the tips of the fingers. <br>
            Finally, we cut a hole in the palm of the hand and stuffed the strings through the hole,<br>
            so when we pulled it, the hand would be able to pick up a water bottle. <br>

            2/3 of the month has already gone by, but it's only felt like a week has gone by. <br>
            Since the last journal entry, we started learning about aerospace engineering. <br>
            We filled out some worksheets and started designing bottle rockets. We paired up <br>
            into groups of 2-3 people. Usually, I would pair up with Aidan and Andres, but <br>
            this time, I paired up with David and Brooklyn. We designed the rocket through CAD <br>
            and then brought 2L bottles to start building the physical model. We attached a pencil <br>
            on one side and attached three cardboard wings on the three other sides. We drew a <br>
            gingerbread design on the middle wing, so we could distinguish it from the other bottles. <br>
            We went out to test the rocket today and our rocket went decently far. <br>

            Thanksgiving break is finally in less than a month. This week, we learned about <br>
            environmental engineering. We filled out a worksheet about environmetal engineering <br>
            after we watched a couple videos on environemtnal engineering and a presentation. <br>
            For our project, we constructed a water filtration system using a bottle, sand, rocks, <br>
            cotton, and pebbles. After we filled the bottle with these materials, we poured dirty water <br>
            into the bottle and watched it filter out the dirt and other filaments, leaving clean water <br>
            as the result. Our water filtration system worked quite extravagantly. <br>
